Notes of changes made in SVN revision 87578

EMP_797_Song_Family.txt

1. For any known host_age with no corresponding host_life_stage, add “Adolescent” since all age < 15 years

2. For ‘feces’ sample, change:
body_habitat: UBERON:feces -> colon
body_site: UBERON:feces -> colon

3. For following annotation:
body_habitat	body_product	body_site
UBERON:skin	UBERON:sebum	UBERON:face
change body_site
UBERON:face -> UBERON:skin of face (so it is consistent with other body_site like skin of hand, foot skin, etc.)

4. remove value ‘ENVO:human-associated habitat’ from column env_biome, consider it as ‘env_feature’.

5. remove value in column env_matter, values are same as body_product. Material collected from host not environment.

6. remove column host_taxid, which is Taxon ID of host, we have host_common_name, we can put ontology term mapping for it if need.

EMP_1064_Bee_Microbiome.txt

1. remove UBERON:tissue, UBERON:body in column body_product. It is not fit the variable, which requires to provide the product produced by body. (so, keep UBERON:secretion)

2. remove value ‘ENVO:village biome’ from column env_biome, which cause confusion.

3. remove value in column env_matter. Material collected from host not environment.

4. remove column host_taxid, which is Taxon ID of host, we have host_common_name, we can put ontology term mapping for it if need.

5. column ‘role’ contains value ‘larvae’, ‘pupae’. I think these are lifecycle stage not social role of bee. So, add new column ‘host_life_stage’, and move these values in the new column.

EMP_1927_HMP_V13.txt
1. For ‘feces’ sample, change:
body_habitat: UBERON:feces -> colon
body_site: UBERON:feces -> colon

2. remove value in column env_matter. Material collected from host not environment.

3. remove column host_taxid, which is Taxon ID of host, we have host_common_name, we can put ontology term mapping for it if need.


EMP_1928_HMP_V35.txt
1. For ‘feces’ sample, change:
body_habitat: UBERON:feces -> colon
body_site: UBERON:feces -> colon

2. remove value in column env_matter. Material collected from host not environment.

3. remove column host_taxid, which is Taxon ID of host, we have host_common_name, we can put ontology term mapping for it if need.

EMP_1928_HMP_V35.txt

1. remove value in column env_matter when sample collected from host, human or dog. keep ‘dust’

2. removed ‘human’ in host_common_name column for those ‘dust’ sample

3. host_taxid for dust is 1256227, ‘indoor metagenome’ (- unclassified sequences). It is not organism. As what we did before, host_taxid is removed.

EMP_10249_ECAM.txt

1. column ‘day_of_life’ mapped to ‘age in days’ which is also host_age. Added ‘age’ column and copy values in column ‘day_of_life’. So, people can also search age filter to find the samples only available in ‘age in days’ now.

2. column ‘geo_loc_name’ with value  USA:NY:NYC, add new column ‘country’ to specify the geographic location in country level.
